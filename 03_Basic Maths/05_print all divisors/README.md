<h2>Print all Divisors</h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr>

You are given an integer `n`. Your task is to implement a function `printAllDivisors` that prints all the divisors of n in ascending order.

### Input:

`n` (1 <= n <= 10^6): An integer for which you need to find and print all divisors.

### Output:

Print the divisors of n in ascending order, separated by spaces.


**Example 1:**
```
Input n:
12

Output:
1 2 3 4 6 12
```

**Explanation:**

The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

**Example 2:**

```Input:
n = 30

Output:
1 2 3 5 6 10 15 30
```

**Explanation:**

The divisors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.

**Note:**
- You should print the divisors in ascending order.
- Do not print duplicates if there are any.
- Only print the divisors separated by spaces.
