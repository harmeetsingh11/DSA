### Time Complexity
O(1), that is constant time.

The comparison of two numbers is a constant time operation, and we are doing it 2 - 3 times.

Hence the time complexity is O(1).

### Space Complexity
O(1), that is constant space.

We are not using any auxiliary space.

Hence the space complexity is O(1).
