# Approach: Sliding Window

## Intuition:
- By maintaining a set of elements within a sliding window of size `k`, we ensure that we only consider elements that fall within the specified range.
- As we iterate through the array, we continuously update the sliding window by adding new elements and removing old ones.
- If we encounter a duplicate element within the sliding window, we return `true`.
- This approach optimizes the time complexity by avoiding unnecessary comparisons, as we only consider elements within the sliding window.

## Code Explanation:
1. Initialize a set (`numSet`) to keep track of the unique elements encountered within the sliding window.
2. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, pointing to the start and end of the sliding window, respectively.
3. Iterate through the array using the `right` pointer.
4. At each step, check if the absolute difference between `right` and `left` exceeds `k`. If it does, remove the element at the `left` pointer from the set and increment `left`.
5. Check if the current element (`nums[right]`) already exists in the set. If it does, return `true` as we have found a duplicate within the specified distance `k`.
6. If the current element is not found in the set, add it to the set.
7. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, return `false`.

In summary, the sliding window approach efficiently handles the problem by maintaining a set of unique elements within a specified distance `k`, allowing for efficient detection of duplicates.
