## Approach: Sliding Window

The approach used in this code is known as the sliding window technique. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Calculate Initial Sum**: The code starts by calculating the sum of the first `k` elements of the `nums` array using the `reduce` method. This initial sum represents the sum of the first window of elements.

2. **Initialize Pointers**: Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized to define the window. `left` points to the start of the window, and `right` points to the end of the window.

3. **Slide the Window**: The code enters a loop where the window is slid through the array `nums`. At each iteration, the window moves one element to the right.

4. **Update Sum**: Inside the loop, the sum is updated by adding the next element (`nums[right + 1]`) to the current sum and subtracting the leftmost element (`nums[left]`). This effectively shifts the window by one element.

5. **Update MaxSum**: After updating the sum, `maxSum` is updated to be the maximum of the current `sum` and the previous `maxSum`. This ensures that `maxSum` always holds the maximum sum encountered so far.

6. **Move Pointers**: Finally, the left pointer is incremented to move the window one step to the right, and the right pointer is also incremented accordingly.

7. **Return Maximum Average**: After sliding the window through the entire array, the maximum average is calculated by dividing `maxSum` by `k`, the size of the window, and returned as the result.

> [!NOTE]
> The sliding window technique optimizes the process of finding the maximum average by avoiding redundant calculations. It achieves this by maintaining a fixed-size window over the array and efficiently updating the window's contents and the associated sum as it slides through the array.

Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the provided code:

### Time Complexity:
  - Initializing the `sum` variable requires iterating through the first `k` elements of the array `nums`, which takes $O(k)$ time.
  - The `while` loop iterates through the remaining elements of the array `nums`, which takes $O(n - k)$ time, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.
  - Within the loop, each iteration involves constant-time operations, such as addition, subtraction, and comparison.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is **$O(k + n - k) = O(n)$**.

### Space Complexity:
  - The space complexity is $O(1)$ because the space used is constant regardless of the input size. The code only uses a constant amount of extra space to store variables like `sum`, `maxSum`, `left`, and `right`.
