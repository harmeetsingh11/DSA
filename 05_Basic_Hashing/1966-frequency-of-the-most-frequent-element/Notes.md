## Approach 1: Sliding Window

To solving this problem efficiently is to utilize a sliding window technique. This technique involves moving a window across the array and adjusting its size dynamically based on certain conditions. In this case, the window represents a subarray of elements that we're considering for incrementing to maximize the frequency of a specific element.

Here's how we applied the sliding window approach in the solution:

1. We begin by sorting the array `nums` in ascending order. Sorting helps us identify the potential candidate elements to maximize their frequency efficiently.

2. We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, which represent the boundaries of our sliding window. Initially, both pointers are positioned at the start of the array.

3. We maintain two variables, `result` and `total`, where `result` keeps track of the maximum frequency encountered so far, and `total` represents the sum of elements within the current window.

4. As we move the `right` pointer forward through the array, we continuously update `total` by adding the element at the current position.

5. At each step, we calculate the difference (`diff`) between the sum of elements within the current window and the sum that would be required if all elements within the window were equal to the element at the `right` pointer multiplied by the size of the window.

6. If `diff` exceeds the given limit `k`, indicating that we've exceeded the maximum number of operations, we need to reduce the size of the window by moving the `left` pointer forward.

7. While shrinking the window, we decrement `total` by subtracting the element at the position pointed by `left`. This ensures that the sum of elements within the window remains accurate.

8. During this process, we update `result` to store the maximum window size encountered so far.

9. We repeat steps 4-8 until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the array.

10. Finally, we return the value stored in `result`, which represents the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing at most k operations.

Now, let's delve into the provided code:

```javascript
var maxFrequency = function(nums, k) {
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  let left = 0,
    right = 0;

  let result = 0,
    total = 0;

  while (right < nums.length) {
    total += nums[right];

    let diff = nums[right] * (right - left + 1) - total;

    while (diff > k) {
      total -= nums[left];
      left++;
      diff = nums[right] * (right - left + 1) - total;
    }

    result = Math.max(result, right - left + 1);
    right++;
  }
  return result;
};
```

This JavaScript function `maxFrequency` takes two parameters: `nums`, an array of integers, and `k`, the maximum number of operations allowed. It returns the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing at most k operations.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- We start by sorting the array `nums` in ascending order using `nums.sort((a, b) => a - b)`.
- We initialize `left` and `right` pointers at the start of the array.
- `result` and `total` are initialized to keep track of the maximum frequency encountered and the sum of elements within the window, respectively.
- We iterate through the array using a `while` loop with the `right` pointer.
- At each iteration, we update `total` by adding the element at the current position.
- We calculate `diff`, the difference between the sum of elements within the current window and the sum that would be required if all elements within the window were equal to the element at the `right` pointer multiplied by the size of the window.
- If `diff` exceeds `k`, we shrink the window by moving the `left` pointer forward and update `total` accordingly.
- We update `result` to store the maximum window size encountered so far using `Math.max(result, right - left + 1)`.
- Finally, we return the value stored in `result`, which represents the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing at most k operations.

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the array `nums` takes O(n log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the array.
- The main loop iterates through the array once. Within each iteration:
  - Calculating `total` and `diff` takes constant time.
  - The inner while loop may iterate at most n times in total, as the left pointer can move from 0 to n-1. However, the total number of iterations across all iterations of the outer loop is still bounded by O(n).
  - Updating `result` and moving the pointers takes constant time.

> Hence, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it **$O(n log n)$**.

### Space Complexity

In Javascript, the sort() function is implemented using the Timsort algorithm, which has a worst-case space complexity of **$O(nlogn)$**

> Therefore, the space complexity of the code is O(nlogn).

## Approach 2: Advanced Sliding Window (From Leetcode)

This approach is an extension of the previous one.

Notice that the only thing we care about is the length of the longest window. We don't need to know what the window itself is. As we slide the window over the array, let's say we find a valid window with a length of len. We no longer care about any windows with lengths less than len, because they could not possibly improve on our answer.

The purpose of the while loop in the previous approach is to shrink the window until it is valid again. In this approach, we will not shrink the window - we will just try to grow it as large as we can.

We will keep the same condition in the while loop that checks if the current window `[left, right]` is valid, but instead of using a while loop, we will just use an if statement. This means `left` never increases by more than 1 per iteration. Because `right` also increases by 1 per iteration, if we cannot find a valid window, we will simply be sliding a window with static size across the array.

However, if we add an element `nums[right]` to the window and the window is valid, then the if statement will not trigger, and left will not be incremented. Thus, we will increase our window size by 1. In this scenario, it implies the current window [left, right] is the best window we have seen so far.

As you can see, it is actually impossible for our window size to decrease, since each iteration increases right by 1 and left by either 0 or 1.

Because our window size cannot decrease, it also means that the size of the window always represents the length of the best window we have found so far - analogous to ans from the previous approach.

At the end of the iteration, the size of our window is `n - left`. We return this as the answer.

**Algorithm**

1. Sort `nums`.
2. Initialize the following integers:
     - `left = 0`, the left pointer.
     - `curr = 0`, the sum of the elements currently in our window.
3. Iterate right over the indices of `nums`:
    - Consider `target = nums[right]`.
Add `target` to `curr`.
    - If the size of the window `right - left + 1` multiplied by `target`, minus `curr` is greater than `k`:
      - Subtract `nums[left]` from `curr`.
      - Increment `left`.
4. Return `nums.length - left`.

### Time Complexity

Given `n` as the length of `nums`,

Time complexity: **$O(nlogn)$**

Each iteration of the for loop costs $O(1)$. This means the sliding window process runs in $O(n)$.

> However, we need to sort the array, which costs **$O(nlogn)$**.

### Space Complexity

In Javascript, the `sort()` function is implemented using the Timsort algorithm, which has a worst-case space complexity of **$O(nlogn)$**

> Therefore, the space complexity of the code is **$O(nlogn)$**.

## Approach 3: Binary Search (from leetcode)

Given an index `i`, if we treat `nums[i]` as `target`, we are concerned with how many elements on the left we can take. In the earlier approaches, we used a sliding window. 

In this approach, we will directly find the left-most index of these elements using binary search.

Let's say that `best` is the index of the furthest element to the left that we could increment to `target = nums[i]`. Note that here, best is analogous to what `left` was after the while loop finished in the first approach. How do we find `best`?

The value of best must be in the range `[0, i]`. We will perform a binary search on this range. For a given index `mid`:

- The number of elements in the window would be `count = i - mid + 1`.
- Thus, the final sum after making every element in the window equal to `target` would be `finalSum = count * target`.
- The original sum of the elements is the sum of the elements from index `mid` to index `i`. We can use a prefix sum to find this `originalSum`.
- Thus, the number of operations we need is `operationsRequired = finalSum - originalSum`.
- If `operationsRequired > k`, it's impossible to include the index `mid`. We update `left = mid + 1`.
- Otherwise, the task is possible and we should look for a better index. We update `best = mid` and `right = mid - 1`.

Essentially, we are binary searching the left bound from the first approach for a given right bound `i`. If we pre-process a prefix sum, then for each `mid`, we have all the necessary information to find `operationsRequired`.

**Algorithm**

1. Define a function `check(i)`:
    - Initialize the following integers:
      - `target = nums[i]`, the current target.
      - `left = 0`, the left bound of the binary search.
      - `right = i`, the right bound of the binary search.
      - `best = i`, the best (furthest left) index that we can increment to `target`.

    - While `left <= right`
      - Calculate `mid = (left + right) / 2`.
      - Calculate `count = i - mid + 1`.
      - Calculate `finalSum = count * target`.
      - Calculate `originalSum = prefix[i] - prefix[mid] + nums[mid]`.
      - Calculate `operationsRequired = finalSum - originalSum`.
      - If `operationsRequired > k`, move `left = mid + 1`.
      - Otherwise, update `best = mid` and `right = mid - 1`.
    - Return `i - best + 1`.

2. Sort `nums`.
3. Create a `prefix` sum of `nums`.
4. Initialize `ans = 0`.
5. Iterate `i` over the indices of `nums`:
   - Update `ans` with `check(i)` if it is larger.
6. Return `ans`.
