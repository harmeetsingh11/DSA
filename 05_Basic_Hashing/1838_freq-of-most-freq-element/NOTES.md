## Approach: Sliding window

1. **Sorting the Array:**

- We start by sorting the array. Sorting helps in efficiently determining the number of operations needed to make all elements in a window equal to the largest element in that window. Sorting takes 
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(nlogn) time.

2. **Using Sliding Window Technique:**

    - The sliding window technique helps in finding the maximum subarray (window) where the total number of increment operations required does not exceed 
𝑘
k.
    - We initialize two pointers, left and right, both set to the beginning of the array. We also maintain a variable total to keep track of the sum of elements within the current window.
   
3. **Expanding the Window:**

    - We iterate through the array using the right pointer.
    - For each element pointed to by right, we add its value to total.
    - We then check if the sum of total plus the allowed increment operations (k) is less than the product of the current window size (right - left + 1) and the current largest element in the window (nums[right]).

4. **Contracting the Window:**

    - If the condition total + k < nums[right] * (right - left + 1) is met, it means that the number of operations required to make all elements in the current window equal to nums[right] exceeds k.
    - In this case, we slide the window to the right by incrementing the left pointer and subtracting nums[left] from total.

5. **Updating the Result:**

    - We update the result with the maximum size of the valid window found during the iteration.

6. **Return the Result:**

    - After iterating through the array, we return the result which holds the maximum frequency of any element after performing at most 
𝑘
k operations.

## Time and Space Complexity:

### Time Complexity:

**Sorting:** Sorting the array takes 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛)
O(nlogn) time.

**Sliding Window:** The sliding window approach iterates through the array once. The inner while loop is executed at most 
𝑛
n times in total because both left and right pointers traverse the array once. This gives us a linear time complexity 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) for the sliding window part.

Combining both parts, the overall time complexity is 

O(nlogn)+O(n)=O(nlogn).

### Space Complexity:

**Extra Space:** We use only a few extra variables (left, right, total, result), which take constant space 
𝑂
(

)
O(1).

**Input Space:** No extra space is used other than the input array, which gives us a space complexity of 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1).
