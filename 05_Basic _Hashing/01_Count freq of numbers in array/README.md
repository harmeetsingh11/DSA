    You are given an array of integers.

Your task is to count the frequency of each element in the array and return an <strong>result</strong> where <strong>result</strong> contains all the <strong>elements</strong> with <strong> frequency </strong> of the each element.

Ensure that the elements in the result array are in the same order as their appearance in the input array. Solve using both Map and objects in JavaScript.
    <p><strong class="example">Example:</strong></p>
    <pre>
        <strong>Input:</strong> [1,1,2,2,2,3]
        <strong>Output:</strong> {1 => 2, 2 => 3, 3 => 1} (if using Map)
        {1:2, 2:3, 3:1} (if using object)
        <strong>Explanation: </strong><br>The element 1 appears 2 times in the input array.
The element 2 appears 3 times in the input array.
The element 3 appears 1 time in the input array.
