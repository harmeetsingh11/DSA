## Brute Force Approach

1. **Function Definition**: The code defines a Python function named `sumOfAllDivisorsBruteForce` which calculates the sum of all divisors of a given integer `n`. The function takes an integer `n` as its argument and returns an integer as the result.

2. **Divisor List Initialization**: An empty list named `divisor_list` is initialized. This list will be used to store the divisors of the numbers.

3. **Outer Loop (Numbers 1 to `n`)**:
    - A `for` loop iterates through numbers in the range from 1 to `n`, represented by the variable `num`.

4. **Inner Loop (Possible Divisors)**:
    - For each `num`, an inner `for` loop (`for j in range(1, int(num**0.5) + 1)`) is used to iterate through possible divisors.
    - Within this inner loop, it checks if `j` is a divisor of `num` by calculating `num % j`. If the result is zero, it means `j` is a divisor of `num`.

5. **Adding Divisors to List**:
    - If `j` is a divisor of `num`, it is added to the `divisor_list`.
    - Additionally, to ensure all divisors are included correctly, it checks if `j` is not equal to `num/j` before adding it to the list. This accounts for both divisors on each side of the square root (if applicable).

6. **Sum Calculation**: After both loops have run for all numbers from 1 to `n`, the code calculates the sum of all the divisors in the `divisor_list` using the `sum()` function.

7. **Returning the Result**: The sum of all divisors is returned as the result of the function.


### Time Complexity Analysis

1. **Outer Loop**:
    - The outer `for` loop iterates from 1 to `n`. This loop runs exactly `n` times.

2. **Inner Loop**:
    - For each value of `num` in the outer loop, the inner `for` loop iterates from 1 to the square root of `num`, which is approximately `sqrt(n)` iterations for each `num`.

3. **Divisor Checking**:
    - Within the inner loop, the code checks whether `num` is divisible by `j` (i.e., `num % j == 0`).

4. **Appending to List**:
    - For each valid divisor found, the code appends it to the `divisor_list`. In the worst case, both divisors (if they exist) will be appended, so this operation is constant time.

5. **Sum Calculation**:
    - After both loops have run for all numbers from 1 to `n`, the code calculates the sum of all the divisors using the `sum()` function. This is a linear operation, as it sums all elements in the `divisor_list`.

As a result, the overall time complexity of the code is dominated by the nested loops:
- The outer loop runs `n` times.
- The inner loop, for each `num`, runs approximately `sqrt(num)` times.

Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of this code is approximately **$O(n * sqrt(n))$**, where `n` is the input integer. This is because it iterates through numbers from 1 to `n` and, for each number, iterates up to the square root of that number while performing constant-time operations for each valid divisor.

The time complexity of O(n * sqrt(n)) indicates that the code's runtime will increase roughly in proportion to the square root of the input integer `n`. As 'n' grows larger, the execution time will increase significantly.


### Space Complexity Analysis

1. **divisor_list (List)**:
    - An empty list named `divisor_list` is initialized to store the divisors of the numbers. The size of this list grows as divisors are found and added to it.
    - In the worst case, when 'n' is prime, each number from 1 to 'n' may have two divisors (itself and 1), resulting in approximately 2 * 'n' elements being added to the list.
    - Therefore, the space complexity attributed to `divisor_list` is O(n).

2. **Variables (int)**:
    - The code uses a few integer variables such as `num`, `j`, and the loop control variables. These variables occupy constant space, and their space usage does not depend on the input 'n'.
    - Therefore, the space complexity due to integer variables is O(1).

3. **Total Space Complexity**:
    - The dominant factor contributing to space complexity is the `divisor_list`, which is O(n).
    - The other variables use a constant amount of space, O(1).

As a result, the overall space complexity of the code is **$O(n)$** due to the space used by the `divisor_list`. This indicates that the amount of memory required by the code grows linearly with the size of the input integer `n`. When `n` is large, the space used by the list can become a significant factor in terms of memory consumption.
